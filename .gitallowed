# == Allowed Patterns File for Git-Secrets-Scanner ==
# ===================================================
# Add all allowed regular expression patterns (false positives)
# to this file (one per line).  Make sure to add a comment line
# describing each defined pattern so it is clear to the team
# what it is for.  This file is NOT the same as .gitignore - you
# cannot allow entire files/folders.
